#in this exercise, I explain how to use Python modules

# For the code in lines six and seven, I use the import function to use all the contents of a module, while the web browser 
function is used to open web pages
via the use of Python code

import webbrowser
>>> webbrowser.open('https://docs.python.org/3/library')


#For the code in lines twelve to fourteen, I used the from function to import part of a module and I used the random
and choice function to pick a random item from any list that is given


from random import choice
>>> direction = choice(['N', 'S', 'E', 'W'])
>>> print(direction)

#this function gives the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970

from time import time as time_now
>>> now = time_now()
>>> print(now)
